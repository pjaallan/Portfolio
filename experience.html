	   <h2>Experience</h2>
	  
	    <p>I have worked in IT for over 20 years. It all started when I was working for Canon as a field engineer, repairing what was then the new technology of digital colour photo copiers. These were capable of being connected to office networks, then in their infancy, using Windows 3.1, Apple Talk and Novell networks.</p>
		 
		 <p>Since then I have worked in desktop support, LAN support, server installations and migrations and have migrated Microsoft Exchange server systems to newer versions. Formal qualifications gained along the way include Novell CNE, Microsoft MCSE and Cisco CCNA.</p>

	   <h2>Interests</h2>
	  
	    <p>My interests away from IT include Rugby Union Football, having played the game as a young man, Glam Rock	music from the UK in the 70's, the history of Tudor England and travelling to and touring the island of Tenerife in the	Canary Islands.</p>
